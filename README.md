## About InertiaJS

Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like you've always done! Inertia works great with any backend framework, but it's fine-tuned for Laravel.

## Learning Laravel Inertia React (client-side)

Once you have your server-side framework configured, you then need to setup your client-side framework. Inertia currently provides support for React, Vue, and Svelte.

You can see the Laravel Inertia tutorial on the official Inertiajs website and also via video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkCQVhWtexQ&list=PLxzARwISlmzgO74VI9Yva7sxbUhJJ56yW&ab_channel=WEBDEVIndo">YouTube</a>.
